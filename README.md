## About the Video Course
With every business being penetrated by data, it’s even more important to move towards functional paradigms to tackle the side-effects of programming, making testing and debugging easier. This course will teach you how to deconstruct data structures and store variable bindings (with closures). You’ll also learn about strong typing, storage allocation, and whether to use boxed (pointer-to-value) or unboxed (value directly) representation using functional programming. 

This fast-paced actionable guide offers seven 30-minute lessons, each followed by a practical exercise to get you up and running. By the end, you’ll be well-equipped with programming concepts that enable robust functional programming, taking you one step closer to proficient programming in Python.
